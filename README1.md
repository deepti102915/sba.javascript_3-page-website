### Description

* For this Skill-based Assessment, i have created a small website Slack Builders and Developers. The main purpose of this website is that any customer can log into this website and look for their dream house. I have used HTML structure and followed the methodology of visual design. I have used CSS for styling my web pages. I have used Java Script to implement the funtions, Loops and mathematical calculations.t

* At the header of the website you can see there are the tabs which directs you to different pages like: Home, Abot Us, Products, Locations, Enquiry, EMI Calculator and contact us.

* If you click on About Us, it will give you the history of the builder.

* If you click on Products, it will provide you all the available projects in the form of tables with the details like City, Project name, cost. There is the video of our construction site if you are interesetd in watching our construction site..

* If you click on Locations, it will provide you the Drop down menu to select the Location and then below is the table to find the contact details for all the available locations.

* If you click on Enquiry, you can find the Enquiry Form, which customer can fill and send us so that we  can answer their queries.

* If we click on EMI Calculator, the customer can find out the EMI and interset paid for the loan. The customer needs to fill the details like Loan amount, Annual Percent Rate & Loan Tenure and then click on Find Out button. The output will be EMI and Total amount the customer will pay once the tenure is ended. The loops used inside the Java Script file will do this canculation only if customer eneters all the details like Loan Amount, Annual Percent Rate and Loan Tenure.

* If you click on Contact Us, you will find the contact details like Email and Phone Number of the Builder.
